# Technical_RAG_Chatbot
This project implements an advanced Retrieval Augmented Generation (RAG) chatbot designed to answer questions based on a fixed set of technical documentation PDFs. It leverages local LLMs via Ollama and incorporates several techniques to improve response quality, ensure factual grounding, provide detailed references, and minimize hallucinations.
